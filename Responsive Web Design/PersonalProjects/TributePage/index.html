      <section><fieldset id="tribute-info"><p>Let's learn something more about John!<span id="tribute-description">Height of Comedy & Life</span>
John Cleese is 6'5" tall, making him one of the tallest comedians around. His height became part of his signature comedic style, often exaggerating his lanky figure in sketches.

<span id="tribute-description">Monty Python Origins</span>
Cleese co-founded Monty Python's Flying Circus in 1969 with fellow comedians like Graham Chapman and Eric Idle. The group revolutionized comedy with their absurd, non-sequitur sketches and Cleese was often cast in authoritative roles, like the hilarious "Ministry of Silly Walks" sketch.

<span id="tribute-description">Fawlty Towers Masterpiece</span>
After Monty Python, Cleese created and starred in Fawlty Towers, often considered one of the greatest sitcoms ever made. He played Basil Fawlty, a misanthropic hotel owner with a knack for offending guests.

<span id="tribute-description">Inspired by Real Hotelier</span>
The character of Basil Fawlty was inspired by Donald Sinclair, a hotel owner Cleese met while staying at a hotel during a Monty Python shoot. Sinclair was so rude to the Python team that Cleese found him perfect for his sitcom.

<span id="tribute-description">Educational Background</span>
Cleese attended Clifton College and later went to the University of Cambridge to study law. While at Cambridge, he joined the prestigious Footlights club, where he discovered his passion for comedy and writing.

<span id="tribute-description">First Big Break</span>
Before Monty Python, Cleese had his first big break writing and performing in The Frost Report, where he met many future Python members. This show helped establish his talent in satirical humor.

<span id="tribute-description">Voice Acting & Hollywood</span>
Cleese voiced King Harold in Shrek 2 and the following films in the franchise. He also appeared in major Hollywood films like A Fish Called Wanda, which he co-wrote and starred in, earning him an Academy Award nomination for Best Original Screenplay.

<span id="tribute-description">Loves Lemurs</span>
Cleese is a passionate animal lover, especially about lemurs. He even has a species of lemur named after him—the Avahi cleesei, or Cleese's woolly lemur.

<span id="tribute-description">Comedy Over Politics</span>
Despite his sharp wit and occasional forays into political satire, Cleese has turned down honors like knighthood, saying he’d rather focus on making people laugh than getting involved in politics.

<span id="tribute-description">Still Going Strong</span>
Even in his 80s, Cleese continues to perform and create. He’s embarked on several tours, like his “Last Time to See Me Before I Die” tour, which features humorous reflections on his long career.

<span id="tribute-description">Bonus Fact</span> He’s Been Married Four Times!
Cleese has been married four times and has often joked about the high costs of his divorces, humorously referencing them in interviews and stand-up shows.</fieldset></section><section id="external-info"><p>If you want to know what is John up to today, have a look at his <a id="tribute-link"href="https://www.instagram.com/johncleeseofficial/?hl=en" target="_blank">Instagram page</a></p>
